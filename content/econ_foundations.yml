  Foundations of Economics:
    _order: ["Overview", "Production Possibility Curve"]

    Overview:
      time_estimate: "60 minutes"
      learning_objectives:
        - "Define economics, scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost."
        - "Distinguish positive vs normative statements with examples."
        - "Differentiate microeconomics and macroeconomics."
        - "Identify the four factors of production and their rewards."
        - "Explain how economic systems answer the three basic questions."
      explanation:
        - "Scarcity: resources are finite while wants are unlimited; scarcity is not the same as a temporary shortage."
        - "Choice: because of scarcity, societies must choose among competing uses of resources."
        - "Opportunity cost (OC): the next best alternative forgone when a choice is made."
        - "From scarcity to PPC: with fixed resources, the set of maximum output mixes forms a boundary (the PPC)."

    Production Possibility Curve:
      time_estimate: "45 minutes"
      diagram: ppc_diagram
      alt_text: "Concave PPC showing trade-offs between Good A and Good B."
      diagram_preamble: "Move the slider to simulate resource/technology changes (shifts)."
      learning_objectives:
        - "Interpret points inside, on, and outside the PPC."
        - "Explain outward and inward shifts and their causes."
      explanation:
        - "Why PPC arises: scarcity forces choice; only certain output mixes are attainable."
        - "Opportunity cost on PPC: moving along the curve shows what must be given up of one good to gain more of the other."
        - "Concavity: resources are specialized, so opportunity cost rises."
      worked_examples:
        - title: "Identify opportunity cost on a PPC"
          steps:
            - "Start at point B (6 of A)."
            - "Move to point C (8 of A)."
            - "Compute the loss in Good B and the gain in Good A."
          solution: "Moving from B to C: +2 units of A costs about 1.4 units of B."
      mcqs:
        - question: "A point outside the PPC represents..."
          options: {A: "unattainable now", B: "productive efficiency", C: "allocative efficiency", D: "underutilization"}
          answer: A
          rationales: {A: "Beyond current capacity.", B: "On the curve.", C: "Needs preferences, not implied.", D: "Inside the curve."}

        lecture_script:
          - "Define assumptions of the PPC (fixed resources/technology)."
          - "Inside vs on vs outside."
          - "Show outward shift causes (resources, technology)."
        socratic_prompts:
          - "If tech improves only for Good A, how does the frontier change?"
        board_plan:
          - "Draw base PPC with points A, B, C; annotate opportunity cost."
        live_checks:
          - "Thumbs check: inside vs on vs outside?"
