    Overview:
      time_estimate: "60 minutes"
      learning_objectives:
        - "Define economics, scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost."
        - "Distinguish positive vs normative statements with examples."
        - "Differentiate microeconomics and macroeconomics."
        - "Identify the four factors of production and their rewards."
        - "Explain how economic systems answer the three basic questions."
      prereq_recap:
        - "Basic graph reading; correlation vs causation."
        - "Percent and ratio calculations (for later topics)."
      explanation:
        - "Scarcity: resources are finite while wants are unlimited; scarcity is not a temporary shortage."
        - "Choice: because of scarcity, societies must choose among competing uses of resources."
        - "Opportunity cost (OC): the next best alternative forgone when a choice is made."
        - "Why economics exists: to study how best to allocate scarce resources (what, how, for whom)."
        - "From scarcity to PPC: with fixed resources, the set of maximum output mixes forms a boundary (the PPC)."
        - "Reading PPC: each point is a choice; the slope measures OC; shifts reflect resource/technology changes."
        - "Foundations: micro vs macro; positive vs normative; factors of production (land, labour, capital, enterprise)."
      tok_insight: |
        Knowledge question: To what extent do simplified models like the PPC help or hinder understanding of real economies?
        Consider assumptions (fixed technology, two goods, ceteris paribus) and the trade-off between simplicity and realism.

        - "Tragakes (3rd ed., Cambridge 2020): Chapter 1 (Scarcity, Choice, Opportunity Cost, PPC)."
        - "See notes on ceteris paribus and model assumptions."
      glossary:
        Scarcity: "Unlimited wants with finite resources."
        Shortage: "Temporary situation where quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at a given price."
        Choice: "Selecting among alternatives because of scarcity."
        Opportunity cost: "The next best alternative forgone when a choice is made."
        Factors of production: "Land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship; rewards: rent, wages, interest, profit."
        PPC: "Boundary of maximum feasible output combinations for given resources and technology."
        Productive efficiency: "On the PPC—cannot increase one good without reducing the other."
        Allocative efficiency: "Mix of goods that maximizes welfare (not shown by PPC alone)."
        Economic growth: "Outward shift of the PPC over time."
        Ceteris paribus: "All else equal—used to isolate relationships."
      worked_examples:
        - title: "Classify statements: positive or normative"
          steps:
            - "Inflation fell to 4.8% vs The central bank should cut rates now."
            - "Ask: can we test the statement with data?"
            - "Label each and justify briefly."
          notes:
            - "Words like should often signal normative."
          solution: "First is positive (testable). Second is normative (value judgement)."

          steps:
            - "You have 2 hours: 1h Econ + 1h Math, or 2h Econ."
            - "If you choose 2h Econ, what is your opportunity cost?"
          notes:
            - "OC is the best alternative forgone, not all alternatives."
          solution: "1 hour of Math is the OC of the extra hour of Econ."
        - title: "Identify factors of production in a scenario"
          steps:
            - "Bakery uses an oven, flour, bakers, and owner’s talent."
            - "Map each to land, labour, capital, enterprise."
          notes:
            - "Capital is man-made aid; land includes natural resources."
          solution: "Oven = capital; flour = land input; bakers = labour; owner = entrepreneurship."
      misconceptions:
        - "Scarcity equals poverty."
        - "Opportunity cost is the money price."

      explanation:
        - "Why PPC arises: scarcity forces choice; only certain output mixes are attainable."
        - "Opportunity cost on PPC: moving along the curve shows what must be given up of one good to gain another."
        - "Concavity: resources are specialized, so OC rises."
        - "Points: inside = inefficiency; on = productive efficiency; outside = currently unattainable."
        - "Shifts vs movements: movements reallocate; shifts change capacity (resources/technology)."
      tok_insight: |
        Perspective: Does an outward shift always mean everyone is better off? Think equity vs efficiency; growth changes size, not necessarily distribution, of the pie.
      worked_examples:
