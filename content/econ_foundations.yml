        - "Hook: real scarcity example (ICU beds, water) → choices must be made."
        - "Define scarcity, choice, opportunity cost with 1 everyday example."
        - "Positive vs normative: show one of each; ask class to label."
        - "Factors of production & rewards: land, labour, capital, enterprise."
        - "Connect to PPC: limited resources ⇒ maximum feasible output boundary."

        - "Positive: 'Unemployment is 5%.' Normative: 'Govt should lower taxes.'"
      time_estimate: "60 minutes"
      learning_objectives:
        - "Define economics, scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost."
        - "Distinguish positive vs normative statements with examples."
        - "Differentiate microeconomics and macroeconomics."

      prereq_recap:
        - "Basic graph reading; correlation vs causation."
        - "Percent & ratio calculations (for later topics)."
      explanation:
        - "**Scarcity**: resources are finite while wants are unlimited; scarcity ≠ temporary shortage."
        - "**Choice**: because of scarcity, societies must choose among competing uses of resources."
        - "**Opportunity cost (OC)**: the next best alternative forgone when a choice is made."
        - "**Why economics exists**: to study how best to allocate scarce resources (what/how/for whom)."
        - "**From scarcity to PPC**: if resources are fixed, the set of maximum output mixes forms a boundary—the PPC."
        - "**Reading PPC**: each point is a **choice**; the **slope** measures OC; **shifts** reflect changes in resources/technology."
        - "Micro vs macro, positive vs normative, and factors of production (land/labour/capital/enterprise) as foundations."
      tok_insight: |
        **Knowledge question:** To what extent do simplified models like the PPC help or hinder understanding of real economies?
        Consider assumptions (fixed technology, two goods, ceteris paribus) and the trade‑off between simplicity and realism.

        - "Tragakes (3rd ed., Cambridge 2020): Chapter 1 — 'What is Economics?' sections on Scarcity, Choice, Opportunity Cost, PPC."
        - "Also see introductory notes on ceteris paribus and model assumptions."
      glossary:
        Scarcity: "Unlimited wants vs finite resources; ever-present condition."
        Shortage: "Temporary market situation where Qd > Qs at a given price; not the same as scarcity."
        Choice: "Selecting among alternatives because of scarcity."
        Opportunity cost: "The next best alternative forgone when a choice is made."
        Factors of production: "Land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship (rewards: rent, wages, interest, profit)."
        PPC: "Boundary of maximum feasible output combinations given resources and technology."
        Productive efficiency: "On the PPC—cannot increase output of one good without reducing the other."
        Allocative efficiency: "Mix of goods that maximizes social welfare; not shown by PPC alone."
        Economic growth: "Outward shift of PPC over time."
        Ceteris paribus: "'All else equal'—used to isolate relationships."
      worked_examples:
        - title: "Classify statements: positive or normative"
          steps:
            - "'Inflation fell to 4.8%' vs 'The central bank should cut rates now'."
            - "Ask: can we test the statement with data?"
            - "Label each as positive/normative and justify briefly."
          notes:
            - "Words like 'should' often signal normative."
          solution: "First is positive (testable with data). Second is normative (value judgement about policy)."
        - title: "Compute opportunity cost from a simple choice"
          steps:
            - "You have 2 hours to study: 1h Econ + 1h Math, or 2h Econ."
            - "If you choose 2h Econ, what is your opportunity cost?"
            - "State it explicitly."
          notes:
            - "Opportunity cost is the best alternative forgone, not all alternatives."
          solution: "1 hour of Math study is the opportunity cost of the extra hour of Econ."
        - title: "Identify factors of production in a scenario"
          steps:
            - "A bakery uses an oven, flour, bakers, and the owner's talent to design recipes."
            - "Map each item to FoP: land, labour, capital, enterprise."
          notes:
            - "Capital is man-made aid to production; land includes natural resources."
          solution: "Oven = capital; flour = input from land; bakers = labour; owner = entrepreneurship."
      misconceptions:
        - "Scarcity equals poverty (No—rich economies still face scarcity)."
        - "Opportunity cost is the money price (It may be time, convenience, etc.)."

          criteria: "AO3 Evaluate"
          model_answer: "Markets harness price signals and incentives for efficiency and innovation, but may underprovide public goods/equity; planning coordinates at scale but faces information/incentive problems. Most adopt mixed systems; effectiveness depends on institutions and context."

          criteria: "AO3 Evaluate"
          model_answer: "True zero OC is rare except with free goods or slack time where no alternative is forgone; generally, some alternative use exists, so OC > 0."

      explanation:
        - "**Why PPC arises**: Scarcity forces **choice**—with fixed resources, only certain output mixes are attainable."
        - "**Opportunity cost on PPC**: moving along the curve shows what must be **given up** of one good to gain more of the other (slope = OC)."
        - "**Concavity**: resources are specialized → increasing OC → bowed‑out frontier."
        - "**Points**: inside = inefficiency/unemployment; on = productive efficiency; outside = currently unattainable."

      tok_insight: |
        **Perspective:** Does an outward shift always mean everyone is better off? Think equity vs efficiency; growth may change the size, not necessarily the distribution, of the pie.
