    Overview:
      time_estimate: "45 minutes"
      learning_objectives:
        - "Define PED and interpret values relative to 1."
        - "Explain the total revenue test."
      explanation:
        - "PED = %ΔQd / %ΔP; magnitude indicates responsiveness."
        - "Elastic (>1), inelastic (<1), unit (=1)."
        - "TR test: in elastic range, P↓ → TR↑; in inelastic, P↓ → TR↓."
      short_questions:
        - question: "State two determinants of PED."
          hint_chain: ["Think substitutes and time."]
          model_answer: "Availability of substitutes, proportion of income, necessity vs luxury, time period."

    Price Elasticity Interactive:
      time_estimate: "50 minutes"
      diagram: elasticity_diagram
      alt_text: "Two demand curves: steep (inelastic) and flat (elastic)."
      learning_objectives:
        - "Compute PED using midpoint formula."
        - "Relate elasticity to revenue outcomes."
      prereq_recap:
        - "Percentage change calculations."
        - "Reading demand curves."
      explanation:
        - "Elastic vs inelastic curves (visual intuition)."
        - "Slope ≠ elasticity; use point P/Q context."
      worked_examples:
        - title: "Compute PED using midpoint method"
          steps:
            - "Initial P=10, Q=100 → New P=12, Q=90."
            - "Compute %ΔP and %ΔQ using midpoint formula."
            - "Calculate PED and interpret."
          notes:
            - "Midpoint avoids base effects."
          solution: "%ΔP=(12-10)/((12+10)/2)=2/11≈18.18%; %ΔQ=(90-100)/95=−10.53%; PED≈0.58 (inelastic)."
      misconceptions:
        - "Elasticity equals slope (it does not)."
      command_terms:
        - term: Calculate
          definition: "Obtain a numerical answer showing steps."
          mini_frame: "State formula → Substitute → Compute → Interpret."
